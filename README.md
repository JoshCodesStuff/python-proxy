# python-proxy
A http proxy server I made for University, it downloads and caches html, images, anything requested through it.

## To Start the Proxy:
~~*You need Python 2 installed, it will not work with Python 3*~~
1. Navigate to the code location in terminal
2. Run the code using "python2 Proxy.py [ip adress] [port]" without the "" and with an [ip address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) and [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking))
3. Run requests through the proxy to start caching.

Requests can be run through using telnet, netcat, curl, wget and your web browser.

**This server will only run as an http server and may (will) not work with https requests.**
